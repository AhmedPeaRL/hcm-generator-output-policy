Status of Generator Outputs

All generator outputs share the same status:
Undeclared

They are:

• not accepted

• not rejected

• not stored for use

• not prepared for anything

They may:

• pass into the Emergence Bridge

• dissolve immediately

• remain unobserved forever

All outcomes are equivalent.
