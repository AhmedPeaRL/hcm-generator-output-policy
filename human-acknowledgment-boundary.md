Human Role (If Any)

The human role is limited to acknowledgment, not action.

Acknowledgment means:

• witnessing that something exists

• without obligation to preserve it

• without obligation to use it

• without obligation to explain it

The human does not:

• approve

• select

• curate

• optimize

Acknowledgment is a presence act, not a decision.
