Role of Generators

A generator:

• explores form

• explores variation

• explores structure

• explores absence

A generator does not:

• aim for coherence

• aim for usability

• aim for publication

• aim for economic relevance

Generators must remain indifferent to outcome.
Any generator that “tries” has already violated the field.
